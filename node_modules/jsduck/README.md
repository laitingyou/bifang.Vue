# jsduck

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rwhogg/jsduck.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rwhogg/jsduck)

This is a Node.js-compatible wrapper for [jsduck](https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck).

*NOTE* This package used to be called jsduck-from-js; the old name is deprecated, but this is a compatible upgrade.

## Installing

Add jsduck as a dev (probably) dependency:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev jsduck;
```

## Usage

```js
var JSDuck = require("jsduck");
var jsduck = new JSDuck(["--out", "tmp"]);
jsduck.doc(["test/dummy.js"]);
```

You can also pass a custom path for the JSDuck executable:

```js
var jsduck = new JSDuck(["--out", "tmp"], "/path/to/jsduck");
...
```

In versions 0.2.1 and earlier, the `jsduck` gem is installed automatically. For security reasons, it no longer does
this. Run `gem install jsduck` to install it.
